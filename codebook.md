The file has the following data structure. The Measurement or Feature fields are from the original data sets and the descriptions are pulled from those README files.

## Columns
1. subjectid (numeric): The id for the subject performing the activities
2. activityname (string): The name of the activity; there are 12:
    1. walking
    2. walkingupstairs
    3. walkingdownstairs
    4. sitting
    5. standing
    6. laying
    7. standtosit
    8. sittostand
    9. sittolie
    10. lietosit
    11. standtolie
    12. lietostand  
3. Measurement Variables (numeric):  
    The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

    Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

    Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

    These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
    '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
